This is a public version of my String bot. Feel free to use it to build the bot for your riddles! Here are the steps to follow:

0. Set up a bot in Discord Developer Portal. In OAuth2->URL Generator, select "bot"->"Administrator" to add the bot to your server. Get the tokens there.

1. Edit bot_auto.py. Follow the "#" instructions and insert information.

2. Edit the txt's: achievements, levels, milestones, secrets, unpw
Format:
achievements.txt: [name]	[path]

levels.txt: [name]	[answer path]
Notice that the answer path also serves as the front path of next level.

milestones.txt: The first row is the names appeared in !stat. Then [level name]	[milestone name].
It must contain the final level. The names in !stat must match with milestones.

secrets.txt: same as levels.txt

unpw.txt: [name of level with un/pw as answer]	[un/pw]
E.g. if one writes down

02	infinite/forever
06	kobe/li

that means levels 03-06 are locked by infinite/forever. Use 'None' if there is no un/pw.

3. Put achievement images as JPG in /cheevos. They must have the names in achievements.txt.

4. Run bot_auto.py.

5. Put /login in your website. Edit login_original.js by following the "//" instructions. In OAuth2->General enter the redirection URL, then choose "identify" in URL Generator.

6. Put stringbot_original.js in your website and edit it. Include it on every page you want to trigger the bot.

7. It is recommended to obfuscate the js files.

Some tips if you are using Heroku:

1. The config files are already here. Just push all files onto Heroku.

2. Give them billing info such that you have enough free hours. No money would be deducted.

3. Install an addon (e.g. New Relic) to ping your bot every half hour.
